What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initialise a git repository using git init creates a git file but with no commits.  You need to do it so you can track the file changes using the git command.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is holding changes that you've made from your working directory.  But you can still discard the changes or commit them, so it's almost like temporary holding area.
